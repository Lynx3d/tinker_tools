  current selection as pivot

Version 1.9.0
*NOTE*: All 1.9.x are considered "unstable" versions. The stable version may
or may not become 2.0, depending on whether the addon name can be kept.

- A load of interface changes:
 * New default window style. You can toggle between new and old
   with '/DT style' chat command (requires reloadui)

   the input fields with the <Tab> key
